P4::Objects Usage Examples
==========================

This directory contains high-quality, running examples of P4::Objects and
P4::Server usage. The P4::Server usage primarily sets up an environment
against which to use the P4::Objects examples.

Setup and Installation
======================

No real setup or installation is required at this time. Simply run
"run_example.pl" from the current directory adding -I options for the
locations of P4::Objects and P4::Server, similar to:

perl -I ../lib -I ~/p4server/lib run_example.pl

The above assumes that you are running this from the "examples" directory of a
standard CPAN distribution of P4::Objects, where ../lib is the home for
P4::Objects.

What It Does
============

run_example.pl
--------------

1.  Sets up the server: It takes the archive file in the current directory and
    uses it to create a server with a dynamically allocated port and a server
    root in the current directory. The server shuts down when the example
    script finishes, but the directories are left behind afterwards for
    inspection.

2.  Runs the example code.
